# Internationalization
- All text must be in messages/en.json and es.json
- Use useTranslations hook with namespaced keys
- Never hardcode text strings

# Theme Support
- Use next-themes for light/dark mode switching
- Use useThemeColor hook for dynamic color access
- Apply theme colors through CSS variables and React style objects
- Support both modes with Tailwind classes:
  ```css
  bg-white dark:bg-[#1B1B1B]
  text-foreground dark:text-slate-200
  ```

# Animations
- Use Framer Motion for component animations
- Keep transitions smooth and consistent
- Respect reduced-motion preferences

# Responsive Design
- Mobile-first with sm, md, lg, xl breakpoints
- Test on all viewport sizes
- Use flex and grid layouts appropriately

# Accessibility
- Support keyboard navigation
- Include ARIA attributes
- Ensure screen reader compatibility
- Test contrast in both themes
