# Canopy Charts LLM Guide

This guide outlines how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) with Canopy Charts.

## Code Ownership Model

Canopy Charts uses a **code-ownership model** rather than a traditional package distribution approach:

- You **own and modify** the code directly, not just consume an API
- The codebase is designed to be **forked and extended**
- There are **no black boxes** - everything can be customized
- The structure is **optimized for LLM comprehension** and extension

## Planned Repository Structure

```
components/        # Core visualization components
hooks/             # React hooks for chart functionality
types/             # TypeScript type definitions
utils/             # Utility functions for data processing
examples/          # Example implementations
```

## Working with LLMs (Coming Soon)

When the codebase is more developed, this guide will include:

- Effective prompts for creating and customizing charts
- Common customization patterns
- Extension points and techniques
- Troubleshooting guidance

## Next Steps

- Explore the [philosophy document](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) to understand our approach
- Check back for updates as we develop the codebase

This guide will be expanded as the codebase develops.
