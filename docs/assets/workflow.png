This is a placeholder for the workflow.png image. 
You'll need to create an actual image file showing the developer workflow:

1. Explore - Browse repository to understand architecture
2. Experiment - Try examples in interactive playground
3. Extend - Work with LLMs to customize code
4. Own - Ship with complete ownership

The image should be placed at docs/assets/workflow.png
