# Canopy Charts Design Philosophy

## Code Ownership Over Package Consumption

Canopy Charts is built on a fundamental principle: **developers should own their visualization code**, not just consume a package. This philosophy shapes everything about how Canopy Charts is designed and used.

### Why Code Ownership?

Traditional charting libraries present several challenges:

1. **Black Box Limitations** - When you hit the limits of the API, you're stuck
2. **Dependency Risk** - Your project depends on external package maintenance
3. **Learning Curve** - Each library has its own complex API to master
4. **Customization Friction** - Customization is limited to what the API allows

The code ownership model addresses these challenges by giving you complete control over the code that powers your visualizations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency Over Abstraction

We prioritize readable, understandable code over clever abstractions. Every part of the system is designed to be easily comprehended and modified.

### 2. Extension Over Configuration

Rather than providing endless configuration options, we provide clear extension points that let you modify the code directly to achieve your goals.

### 3. Guidance Over Restriction

Instead of restricting what you can do, we provide guidance on how to achieve common goals while leaving all possibilities open.

### 4. AI-Assisted Customization

The codebase is structured to be easily understood and modified with the assistance of LLMs, making customization faster and more accessible.

## Practical Implementation

These principles manifest in several ways:

1. **Clear Component Structure** - Components are organized for easy comprehension
2. **Explicit Extension Points** - Code includes clear markers for where to extend
3. **Comprehensive Examples** - Examples demonstrate common customization patterns
4. **LLM-Optimized Documentation** - Documentation designed for both humans and AI

## The Development Workflow

The Canopy Charts workflow embraces modern development practices:

1. **Start with a Foundation** - Begin with our code as your foundation
2. **Understand Through Examples** - Learn from our examples
3. **Extend with AI Assistance** - Use LLMs to help customize the code
4. **Own Your Implementation** - Ship with complete ownership of your visualization code

## Comparison to Traditional Libraries

| Traditional Libraries             | Canopy Charts                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| You consume an API                | You own the code                       |
| Limited by what the API allows    | Unlimited customization potential      |
| Dependency on package maintenance | Complete control over your code        |
| Learning curve for each library   | Learn once, extend as needed           |
| Black box implementation          | Transparent, modifiable implementation |
